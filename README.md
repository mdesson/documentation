# Concordia University Open Data HUB 

Technology has allowed Concordia to collect large amounts of data and information on a variety of topics, which the university feels should be accessible to all. Concordia’s Open Data Hub makes machine-readable data easy to access from a single point and free to reuse without copyright, patents or other restrictions.
